# Globe

Globe is a C# / WPF program for displaying a 3D globe that can be rotated and tilted.  The globe can be set to display an image file selected by the user.  The primary purpose of this program is to serve as an example for some discussions on my blog at http://awesome-worlds.blogspot.com.  The code in this program will serve as a basis for later excursions in procedural planet generation.
